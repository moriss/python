#Alternate try except code (3) to capture : if not, ValueError and TypeError etc.Take your time and maybe start only with handling an empty string.
# Create 3 versions of the same code outcome. v1.v2.v3 for each 1 to 5
#v1=just easy v2=concatination v3=some shorthand v4=Fill with existing analytical and manipulative functions
#STICK WITH V1 UNTIL YOU FEEL CONFIDENT

#TYPE YOUR CODE HERE
