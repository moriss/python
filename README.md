You have now clonde this repo to Carl. Your plan is to build this repo 
whilst following Chuck Severence's course on Python. 

python with doctor buck aka chuck severence

I initially signed in with google(only option) at https://www.py4e.com/login

He recomended learning python then C then it prepares the way for a degree etc. 

The secret number for the C test is 42

This video explains it all

I have dowonloaded a python "framework" on carl's bodhi laptop. I will put the chatgpt instructions in a different file. 

I'm currently working my way through his course as follows:
1. I'm using try.py in the mytests folder for muscle memory. A list of tasks to warm me up. I will add to the list as I go.

2.  The other folder chuck_1 has chucks folders in it as I progress through the course.

I am using written notes in the shed to follow this course. It's therefor useful to read your notes from time to time.
