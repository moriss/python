After a condition you need a colon.
ie: if x < 3:
	print("x is greater than 3")
else: print("x is not greater than 3")
And if you don't place the correct tabs, you will get errors.

Below is the only way this worked for me:
num=input('pick a number! ')
numb=int(num)
if numb < 6 :
        print('Your chosen  number is less than 6, it is ',numb)
if numb > 6 :
        print('Your number is over 6, it is',numb)
print('this game is now over')
