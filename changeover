Running the code
python <filename>

+     for %i", or %s", or %li", etc etc... It concatinates strings. Joins one to another
print for printf

from cs50 import get_string  for  #include <cs50.h> 

#  for commenting out //

nothing in place of semi colons  so semicolons no more!

Other notes
formating and literal printing
So these are your words! Asking a language to format a string means to uderstand them as values rather than literarly printing everything out as a string.
