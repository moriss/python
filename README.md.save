INSTRUCTIONS 
#############
9th October 24: NOTE: You have a logic issue in try.py you need to resolve!
AT: You now need to attempt worked exercise 3.1 (on chrome tab). Explanation (including file structure) is on the sheet dated 1st Oct 24.
Once you succeed, it can be added to your try.py also. Mark your try.py for each exercise added to 'myfiles' by prefixing it with MF:. 

############
MEMORY MUSCLE:
25th September update:
You realised it was more important to spend time on using memory muscle to write code. Therefore: Add exercises to try.py and attempt at least one before moving onto chuck's videos. 

A completed try.py can be 'saved as' in Chuck's py4e folder (exactly how he does it)

Other things can be saved in myfiles within a certain folder.










below is older







Do one of the exercises listed in Desktop/python/try.py

If the task in try.py has already been added to the Chuck's folder, prefix the task explanations with a 'CH'

Check 'At' on mobile phone to see which Chuck video you are on.
Chuck's folder is at: Desktop/python/py4e

Refer to your written notes:Currently page 4

Task Notes:
18th September 24
You have stalled on being able to open different terminal tabs on the command line (for quick access to all your required files). The chatgpt conversation is Terminal Commands very bottom.
There is also scrap paper dated 18th sept 24 with your notes on it.

Before looking into above, you were in the process of adding time and a half to ex_03_01.py inside py4e/ex_02_02




BACKGROUND

You have now cloned this repo to Carl. Your plan is to build this repo 
whilst following Chuck Severence's course on Python. 

python with doctor buck aka chuck severence

I initially signed in with google(only option) at https://www.py4e.com/login

He recomended learning python then C then it prepares the way for a degree etc. 

(The secret number for the C test is 42)

This video explains it all  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uqgiFhW0Fs&list=PLi6KG1XeZGOemKoHWrm2rrEqAhmZnRxfd

I have dowonloaded a python "framework" on carl's bodhi laptop. I will put the chatgpt instructions in a different file. 

I'm currently working my way through his course as follows:
1. I'm using try.py in the mytests folder for muscle memory. A list of tasks to warm me up. I will add to the list as I go.

2.  The other folder chuck_1 has chucks folders in it as I progress through the course.

I am using written notes in the shed to follow this course. It's therefor usefulto read your notes from time to time.

Although I said I'm using the written notes, I also have a file structure systemin place

py4e has all the course exercises as I mirror what Chuck is doing. 

python has a try.py file where I have a list of 'boiler plate' coding tasks to build my memory muscle. These are the tasks found in chuck's exercises which I am following on the youtube videos.
